<h2 id="am-i-special">Am I special?</h2>

<p>Yes you are. And I am special, too.</p>

<p>I think every human being is special, but only a few among us stand out of the crowd. Why?</p>

<p>Let’s simplify things a bit and say we are talking about my own little niche of human beings: tech specialists, where <em>tech</em> is somewhat equal to <em>Computer Science</em>.</p>

<p>Why do I usually stand out of the crowd, when it comes to my work as a tech specialist?</p>

<p>Here are some of the reasons people come up with, when talking about me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>He’s a creative genius: he just spends all the day watching Star Wars movies, then suddenly come up with a new crazy idea that actually works!</li>
  <li>He’s the brain in the room. Mother nature has been very generous with him.</li>
  <li>He’s sort of a clairvoyant! Always ahead of the curve.</li>
  <li>He knows everything, remembers everything. I can’t do it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bullshit.</p>

<p>I’ve been training all my life. Literally, all my life. In fact, I’ve been training since I was a kid of 3.</p>

<p>I want to unveil the secret behind my superpowers, and I hope to make you start thinking about the power of good habits you keep on training all your life.</p>

<h2 id="be-contemplative">Be contemplative</h2>

<p>Ok I cheated. Being contemplative at age 3 isn’t something you can just learn when you are – in fact – 3 years old.</p>

<p>But it’s something I know where it comes from: my mother loved me dearly. She was my rock, she never lost her nerve with me. I was free to experiment and play, and all the time I felt safe.</p>

<p>She quit <strong>everything</strong> while she was pregnant and over the months after I was born. Alcohol, some cosmetics, everything. I didn’t get any risky molecule before I was born, nor through her milk.</p>

<p>She cared for my alimentation. Lot’s of cod and healthy food in general. I had my first bag of chips around 10.</p>

<p>And that’s also why I remember so much about my first years.</p>

<p>The first time I came to know I was special happened when I was in kindergarten.</p>

<p>In a class full of kids of 3, you would expect a lot of noise at any given second. And noisy we were.</p>

<p>Our teacher, Miss Susanna, introduced us to Tom &amp; Jerry.</p>

<figure class="text-center">
	<img src="/images/posts/2014-06-09-4-habits-that-could-make-you-win/Tom-and-Jerry-4.jpg" alt="Tom and Jerry" class="img-thumbnail" />
</figure>

<p>Everybody was excited while she pointed at Tom on her illustrated book, then Jerry.</p>

<p>Noise, laughs, kids running everywhere.</p>

<p>Not me. I was seated at my desk, silent, and stared at the book for a minute then lowered my head and started playing with some toy I had picked in the classroom.</p>

<p>Miss Susanna noticed that, decided I was the only one who wasn’t paying attention, and asked my parents to come visit and talk about <em>my problems</em>.</p>

<p>It happened during a normal day, in the classroom. Noise, laughs, and stuff.
Seeing my parents there, I knew there was something strange going on. So I decided to pretend I was playing but instead pay attention at what they where saying.</p>

<p><em>“The boy is not normal, you should have him see some professional for – you know – help. I was talking about Tom &amp; Jerry and everyone else was excited about them but little William.”</em> – she started.</p>

<p>Then she continued – <em>“See? Sweeties, do you remember Tom &amp; Jerry? Who are they?”</em> – she asked to the class, to demonstrate her point.</p>

<p>Noise, laughs, and stuff.</p>

<p><em>“No one? Come on, who’s Tom and who’s Jerry?”</em></p>

<p>Noise, laughs, and stuff.</p>

<p>Nobody knew who they where, because nobody was paying attention when she was talking about them.</p>

<p>Nobody but one.</p>

<p>I raised my head, joyfully said something like <em>“Tom is the cat and Jerry is the mouse! I like Jerry: he makes me laugh when he tricks Tom!”</em> and continued to play with whatever I was pretending to play with.</p>

<p>Miss Susanna almost fainted, my mother politely thanked her and just walked away with my father, and nobody else ever thought I wasn’t paying attention at anything.</p>

<p>Be contemplative. Always pay attention at what happens around you. Always.</p>

<h2 id="lateral-thinking">Lateral thinking</h2>

<p>Or, <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">Eureka moments</a> aka “<em>Doctor Gregory House</em> effect”.</p>

<p>If you’ve started being contemplative and paying attention at what happens around you, it will pay out in the long run.</p>

<p>Eureka moments happen when you let third-party random inputs help you in solving a problem at hand, or come up with some new great idea.</p>

<p>Talk about connecting the dots.</p>

<p>This is not some magic or superpower, you must train for it. And it actually is easier than you think.</p>

<p>Look at comedians. They take a seemingly normal everyday fact, let it permeate their other thoughts, then <em>BOOM!</em> you are laughing.</p>

<p>Of course professional comedians are masters in this art, but even they started with the first step, right?</p>

<p>Your life is full of inspiration. Train your brain at being influenced by what happens around you. Take mental or real notes of whatever you experience and it’s interesting: a flower, a word, a videogame, a story read while waiting for your turn at the barber shop, a song, really whatever entices your brain.</p>

<p>Someday they will start flowing back just when needed, and you won’t have to do nothing but saying out loud: <em>“Of course! I <strong>knew it!</strong>“</em>.</p>

<h2 id="know-thyself">Know Thyself</h2>

<p>My wife says I know myself way more than the average Joe. And she’s right: I’ve been training all my life for that.</p>

<p>When I’ve being lazy, unpolite, motivated, strangely happy, I can explain exactly why, if I want.</p>

<p>And just like with the other three points in this post, it’s easy to start: for example, being contemplative about me I noticed that it’s better for me to speak less after a glass of beer because I tend to instantly lose my politically correct self.</p>

<p>The beer thing is a start, but knowing myself allows me to act like a superhero at work now that I’m starting to master the art.</p>

<p>A couple years ago I was given the task of designing the UX for a new product in a market space I knew nothing about. In 4 hours. For a meeting with the big wigs.</p>

<p>Well, s**t happens.</p>

<p>So I grabbed the documents we had, and spent the first hour reading them and paying attention at every detail.</p>

<p><strong>Then I fired up Bejeweled on Facebook and played for the whole second hour.</strong></p>

<figure class="text-center">
	<img src="/images/posts/2014-06-09-4-habits-that-could-make-you-win/bejeweled.jpg" alt="A bejeweled screen" class="img-thumbnail" />
</figure>

<p>The remaining two hours I spent working at the UX in Balsamiq Mockups and then at the meeting I blew everyone’s mind.</p>

<p>What happened?</p>

<p>There was chaos all around me, I was in a hurry, and felt the pressure of an incoming meeting with the big brasses.</p>

<p>But I knew myself, and I knew what I needed to do in such a messy situation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get input, all of it, in the little to nothing time available.</li>
  <li>Let it sink, let it settle, protect those barely forming ideas from the surrounding chaos. Hypnotize myself with a <strong>repetitive</strong>, <strong>calming</strong>, somewhat pleasurable activity (playing Bejeweled) while the input is being processed by my lateral thinking chops.</li>
  <li>Ship.</li>
  <li>Win.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="keep-on-reading">Keep on reading</h2>

<p>Impressed coworkers and bosses often ask me how can I know so much about almost everything.</p>

<p>That’s what they think, at least.</p>

<p>To be honest, I know a little about a vast amount of relevant topics, plus a lot about a couple ones.</p>

<p>The fact is, my little is still way better then their almost nothing. And these are highly skilled people who know a lot about their couple main topics.</p>

<p>Why is that?</p>

<p>Because I read. I read like a freak since I learned how to (at 6, like everyone else).</p>

<p>I read comics, novels, newspapers, programming books, song lyrics, blog posts, elevator signs, flyers, tweets, <strong>even</strong> videogame instruction booklets!</p>

<p>Well, honestly, who wouldn’t read the <a href="http://blog.ihobo.com/2007/02/discworld-noir.html"><em>Discworld Noir</em> instruction booklet</a>?</p>

<p>I read when I am in the toilet, I read during breaks in a TV show or even during the TV show itself if it’s boring.</p>

<p>I read before getting asleep, and this is a pro-tip: what you read before getting asleep, your brain will better assimilate and it will put it aside for the exact moment you will need it.</p>

<p>I read. All that information is there for you to read it.</p>

<p>Time will come for some lateral thinking, and that Eureka Moment you were waiting for.</p>

<h2 id="so-heres-the-secret-sauce-for-my-superpowers">So, here’s the secret sauce for my superpowers</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Be contemplative</li>
  <li>Train lateral thinking</li>
  <li>Know Thyself</li>
  <li>Keep on reading</li>
</ol>

<p>If you’ll start doing all this things right now, time will come when you’ll be in need for the right idea, or the right bit of information, at the right time.</p>

<p>And you’ll just know it.</p>

<p>Like I just know it. <em>Out of magic</em>, no less.</p>
