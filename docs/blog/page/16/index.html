<p>Today I got a very kind email from a reader of <a href="/bootstrap-in-practice">Bootstrap In Practice, my ebook about Bootstrap 3 for starters</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi William,</p>

  <p>I recently bought your book. I think its great! Very useful information 
and you didn’t hold back on examples.</p>

  <p>I am writing a book on Clinical Documentation. It’s focused on teaching doctors
how to write patient notes or their findings.</p>

  <p>Would you suggest using a template?
What e-book software did you use?</p>

  <p>Do you have any ideas on free options for drawing up an e-book?</p>

  <p>Best,
Vic Phillips</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He’s also writing a book, and asked me what tools I used for mine. I thought it would have been nice to write down something about my toolchain, hence this blog post.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>I wouldn’t be able to make any progress without my retina MacBook Pro. Its awesome battery life, CPU power, SSD storage and 16GB RAM really made the difference.</p>

<p>I was able to use all the software you are going to read about and keep them all open at the same time without any problems ever.</p>

<h2 id="backups">Backups</h2>

<p>I kept the whole project in a private git repository on BitBucket.<br />
Using git allowed me to test some variations and to better organize the progress of the work, but also saved me some bandwidth thanks to its good-enough use of deltas also for binary files.</p>

<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>

<p>I wrote the whole thing in Markdown on <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. I chose Markdown because it’s a simple enough plain text format <strong>and</strong> gets nicely formatted once I need a <a href="https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview">quick preview</a>.</p>

<p>I wrote an outline, then a file per chapter. The order of the chapters changed a bit during the final revisions and I also ended up splitting the book into two sections: <em>Knowing Bootstrap</em> and <em>Using Bootstrap</em>.</p>

<p>You can find the final <a href="/blog/2013/09/06/bootstrap-in-practice-tomorrow/">table of contents in a previous blog post</a>.</p>

<h2 id="screenshots">Screenshots</h2>

<p>The screenshots were all taken from Safari. Its iconic visual design is just the perfect kinda <em>neutral</em> chrome for screenshots.</p>

<p>I then cropped and adjusted them a bit in Photoshop whenever needed.</p>

<h2 id="actual-ebook-authoring">Actual ebook authoring</h2>

<p>The actual ebook was then composed in <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibooks-author/">iBooks Author</a>.</p>

<p>iBooks Author comes with a good, if tiny, collection of templates. If you need more, there’s plenty on <a href="http://www.ibooksauthortemplates.com/">iBooks Author Templates</a>.</p>

<p>By the way, I wanted my ebook to be personal, simple, and different from any other book out there. So I just took one of the default templates and stripped it down of every color and shenanigan.</p>

<p>Once I obtained a clean foundation, I started adding my own styling for the Chapter, Section and Page layouts.</p>

<p>I also created my own styles for the various textual components: headings, paragraphs, and the like.</p>

<p>When I was ok with the results, I started copying the markdown text into iBooks Author and applying my styles to it.</p>

<p>For the code snippets the book is filled with, I used a dirty trick: I set Xcode to my syntax highlighting style of choice, copied a code snippet, then used <em>Paste and Retain Style</em> inside iBooks Author.<br />
Since I chose a dark color for the background, I just had to set it again for the paragraph because it doesn’t get retained when you copy it from Xcode.</p>

<p>Once the book was done, I just exported it in PDF.</p>

<p>Last but not least, my ebook has a landscape layout but iBooks Author only knows how to deal with portrait covers. So I had to design my cover in Photoshop and replace it using Adobe Acrobat Pro.</p>

<p>Thanks Adobe for your 30-day free trials!</p>

<h2 id="marketing-and-all-the-rest">Marketing and all the rest</h2>

<p>Just a quick list here:</p>

  <li>Mailing list while I was writing: <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a></li>
  <li>30 day free course with additional tips: <a href="https://convertkit.com/">ConvertKit</a></li>
  <li>Sales: <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a></li>
  <li>Sales page: <a href="/bootstrap-in-practice">hosted on this blog</a>, with another <a href="http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB07284K4">self made Bootstrap 3 template</a></li>
