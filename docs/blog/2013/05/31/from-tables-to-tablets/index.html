<p>This is a three-part post I’m writing about my personal love story with CSS and web standards.</p>

<p>After 15 years, I think this passion of mine deserves a little recap to help me better appreciate
the past and focus on the next — for sure — decades of wonderful adventures.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-of-3-childhood">Part 1 of 3: Childhood</h2>

<p>Well, in 1998 I was 21 so not really a child anymore, but in regard to the Internet in general and web development in particular I was at square 1.</p>

<p>I was gradually switching from playing keyboards to playing my computer’s keyboard; I also started reading computer magazines, one of which was — wait for it — <em>Computer Magazine</em>: an italian monthly publication which would come with a juicy CD sporting all sorts of exciting new softwares for us to try and later purchase.</p>

<p>It was the wild <em>Age of Shareware</em>.</p>

<p>Long story short, here it comes <em>Microsoft Publisher 98</em>.<br />
It was clean, it had templates, it was WYSIWYG, I had something to say and one of the very first available 56K internet connections in Italy.<br />
Soon my first website was online, at Geocities.<br />
By then, I had discovered the <em>View HTML</em> option in my web browser but still I wasn’t able to understand what I was seeing.</p>

<p>Then, in 1999, I had my hands on a copy of <em>Macromedia Dreamweaver</em>. I still can remember that exact moment when, as I was fiddling with the variuos options to see if I had found a suitable replacement for <em>Publisher</em>, my mind was suddenly blown away by this exact thought:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aspetta! Vuoi dire che io clicco sulla roba che vedo e tu mi scrivi l’HTML corrispondente sotto il naso?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which, in english, would have been more or less:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wait! You telling me I click on stuff on the screen and you write HTML in my face?</p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="text-center">
	<img src="/images/html-written.jpg" alt=" " class="img-thumbnail" />
	<figcaption>
		<p>Me at the time of my sudden clarity moment</p>
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But, as often happens, life is not all kittens and HTML and it wasn’t until 2000 that I started writing HTML instead of clicking on things to produce it.<br />
That year I landed my first real job at <em>L’Unione Editoriale</em>, a publishing house which was at the time the veteran of the italian part of the web.</p>

<p>There I finally learned to code HTML and write fairly complex layouts from the very start.<br />
Because, guess what, they were all <strong>table layouts</strong>.</p>

<p>I know, shame on me. But wait till <a href="/blog/2013/06/02/from-tables-to-tablets-part-2-of-3-adolescence/">Part 2</a>, where I’ll redeem myself getting to know — and falling in love with — CSS!</p>
