title: "How to set up environment specific configurations with Ionic and Webpack"

At the time of writing, Ionic hasn't any official way to get environment specific configuration variables.

There's an [open discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/issues/762), but everyone is currently on their own about this.

So of course I came up with my own solution.

I'm going to describe it like it was the best solution in the world, like of course everyone should be doing this like I do.

In fact, there's plenty more ways to solve this problem. This is just how I chose to solve it.

## 1. How many environments?

Two: `dev`(elopment) and `prod`(uction).  
I'd really like to also have `stag`(ing) and `test`(ing), but first I'd have to find a better way to triage the current environment than the `IONIC_ENV` variable.

## 2. JSON files to store the variables

JSON files are easy to read, and fairly easy to edit. They also are very easy to import into a node script.

I have two of them:

  *  `/config/config-dev.json`
  *  `/config/config-prod.json`

### Sample `/config/config-dev.json` file:

```
{
    foo: "bar",
    baz: "fooBar"
}
```

## 3. Custom Webpack configuration for Ionic

This is an important one: Ionic uses Webpack, and we can specify our own Webpack configuration file. But if we do, the next time we update `@ionic/app-scripts` Ionic might stop working because we are missing some new configuration detail.

Instead we keep the official configuration, and expand it.

  *  Add the following block to your `/package.json`:

```
    "config": {
        "ionic_webpack": "./config/webpack.config.js"
    },
```

  *  Create `/config/webpack.config.js` and paste this code in it:

```
const webpackConfig = require('../node_modules/@ionic/app-scripts/config/webpack.config');
const webpack = require('webpack');

const ENV = process.env.IONIC_ENV;
const envConfigFile = require(`./config-${ENV}.json`);
const fooConfig = envConfigFile.foo;
const bazConfig = envConfigFile.baz;

webpackConfig.plugins.push(
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
        webpackGlobalVars: {
            foo: JSON.stringify(fooConfig),
            baz: JSON.stringify(bazConfig)
        }
    })
);
```

As you can see, we are getting the official Webpack configuration and pushing a new plugin into it. No overrides, just an addition.

## 4. A configuration service

Create `/src/providers/configuration/configuration.service.ts`.  
You may have noticed I don't dig the Ionic CLI proposed convention of naming a service *"provider"*. I also like to always know what kind of file I'm about to open, hence the `.service` part of the name.

This is where we use the newly defined `webpackGlobalVars` object to inject the environment-driven values into our Ionic / Angular code.

```
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

declare const webpackGlobalVars: any;

@Injectable()
export class ConfigurationService {
    public static apiServer = webpackGlobalVars.foo;

    public static fooBar = {
        bazBaz: 'foo',
        fooBar: webpackGlobalVars.baz
    }

    // Add more configuration variables as needed
}
```

I chose to make them `static` out of sheer lazyness: this way, I don't have to inject the service: I just `import` it and use it: `const myConst = ConfigurationService.fooBar`.

Now that I think about it, the `@Injectable` decoration might be unnecessary. I'll try to remove it one day or another.

## Conclusion

So this is how I tackle the problem of having environment specific variables in Ionic.

Now I will have the values from `/config/config-dev.json` when I'm developing the app.  
When I use the `--prod` flag, I will have the values from `/config/config-prod.json` instead.

I think it's fairly concise, effective, and as future proof as it gets.
