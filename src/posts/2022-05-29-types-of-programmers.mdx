Over the course of my career I had the fascinating privilege of working side by side with very smart people, crazy people, kind people, bad people.  
We programmers are all smart, and a bit crazy, but at the end of the day we are all just people.

Here's four types of us.

## The Leeroy Jenkins

Brave almost to the point of being dumb, this YOLO champion charges head-first into every coding task without thinking twice.

The [Leeroy Jenkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4) programmer will fool you into thinking they are listening to your instructions and advice, but look closer and you'll notice they zoned out after two seconds and they're just waiting for the slightest hint of a signal to charge towards the unknown.

And that's the point. Since they don't know the unknown, and they never ever take a moment to think and plan, they usually fail. Spectacularly.

And now it's not their problem anymore: it's your problem.  
Because they already moved onto the next ~~victim~~ project.

## The Used Car Dealer

## The Barbarian

## The Sniper

## A confession

## Your turn

What about you? Are you one of these types of programmers? Is there another type I didn't include?
