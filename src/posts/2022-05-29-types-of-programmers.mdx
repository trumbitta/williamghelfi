Over the course of my career I had the fascinating privilege of working side by side with very smart people, crazy people, kind people, bad people.  
We programmers are all smart, and a bit crazy, but at the end of the day we are all just people.

Here's four types of us.

## The Leeroy Jenkins

## The Used Car Dealer

## The Barbarian

## The Sniper

## A confession

## Your turn

What about you? Are you one of these types of programmers? Is there another type I didn't include?
