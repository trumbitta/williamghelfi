Over the course of my career I had the fascinating privilege of working side by side with very smart people, crazy people, kind people, bad people.  
We programmers are all smart, and a bit crazy, but at the end of the day we are all just people.

Here's four types of us.

## The Leeroy Jenkins

Brave almost to the point of being dumb, this YOLO champion charges head-first into every coding task without thinking twice.

The [Leeroy Jenkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4) programmer will fool you into thinking they are listening to your instructions and advice, but look closer and you'll notice they zoned out after two seconds and they're just waiting for the slightest hint of a signal to charge towards the unknown.

And that's the point. Since they don't know the unknown, and they never ever take a moment to think and plan, they usually fail. Spectacularly.

And now it's not their problem anymore: it's your problem.  
Because they already moved onto the next ~~victim~~ project.

## The Used Car Dealer

Oh boy. This is my favorite. And by *"favorite"* I mean *"nemesis"*.

With their uncanny oratory skills, and unwavering predilection for bombastic, high-sounding, gibberish explanations, this quintessential narcissist will absolutely wreck your project if you let them.

The Used Car Dealer programmer knows words. They have the best words.  
And they are not afraid to use them.

When asked for some quick explanations, they will reply with the longest possible streak of academic-sounding words just to make sure you don't understand and at the same time they look magnificent in the eyes of your boss.

Used Car Dealer programmers are also known to ask you seemingly innocent questions, get a perfectly clear and simple answer, only to then double down and overwhelm everyone with demands of a PhD dissertation about what you just told them. And it's not that they would be able to understand it, either.

This absolute pain in every colleague's bum thrives in environments where upper level managers are non-technical at all.  
They will come into your team, they will make friends with your non-technical boss, they will get a promotion or two at the expense of the smart introverts who will just leave, they won't get any actual work done and maybe leave a mess or two for you to fix, and then off they'll go up the career ladder or onto the next company.

## The Barbarian

## The Sniper

## A confession

## Your turn

What about you? Are you one of these types of programmers? Is there another type I didn't include?
