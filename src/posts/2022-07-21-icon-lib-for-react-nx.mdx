Sorry for the lame title: this time I just wanted it to be [obvious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4UIIISgl2U).

One of the most frequently asked questions in [the Nx Community Slack workspace](https://go.nrwl.io/join-slack?utm_source=nx.dev) is along the lines of *"I really need to have my SVG icons in a separate lib. I think I'm near the solution but it just doesn't work!"*.  
This post is my answer. Now I have a handy link to share with everyone who asks that question.

## A little less conversation

If you want to follow along, you can use [gitpod-nx, my tool to quickly create a new Nx workspace in Gitpod and start hacking away](https://github.com/trumbitta/gitpod-nx).

Or, if you prefer, you should be able to easily pick up from where you need and apply every step to your project with no problems.

## A little more action

- Create a new Nx workspace with [gitpod-nx](https://github.com/trumbitta/gitpod-nx). Let's call it `icontopia`. See details below.

```sh
Enter a scope name (used by TypeScript path aliases and published NPM packages):
icontopia
✔ What to create in the new workspace · react
✔ Application name                    · app
✔ Default stylesheet format           · styled-components

 >  NX   Nx is creating your v14.4.3 workspace.

   To make sure the command works reliably in all environments, and that the preset is applied correctly,
   Nx will run "npm install" several times. Please wait.

✔ Installing dependencies with npm
✔ Nx has successfully created the workspace.
```

`styled-components` is just my personal preference and it doesn't impact what we are going to achieve here.

- Create a workspace lib for the icons - **this is the first step if you are trying to apply the instructions to a repo you already have**

```sh
npx nx generate @nrwl/workspace:library icons --standaloneConfig --unitTestRunner=none --no-interactive
```

- Edit the `tsconfig.base.json` entry for the `icons` lib

```json
"paths": {
  "@icontopia/icons/*": ["libs/icons/src/lib/*"]
}
```

- Delete `libs/icons/src/lib/icons.ts`

- Edit `libs/icons/src/index.ts`

```ts
// Fake!
```

- Put at least one SVG icon inside the lib.  
Here's one for you from [tabler/tabler-icons](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons/blob/master/icons/circle.svg), paste it into `libs/icons/src/lib/icon-circle.svg`.

```xml
<!-- libs/icons/src/lib/icon-circle.svg -->
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-circle" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round">
  <path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/>
  <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9" />
</svg>
```

- Import an icon from your library <3

```tsx
import { ReactComponent as IconCircle } from '@icontopia/icons/icon-circle.svg';

export function NxWelcome({ title }: { title: string }) {
  return <p>Hello icon <IconCircle /></p>;
}

export default NxWelcome;
```

[And then Bob's your uncle](https://external-preview.redd.it/tQMndO1YP-DehNvC-hbs0AGdI0luSmxsEanEqQNgaMo.jpg?auto=webp&s=7a2e263a4b37aa903cfd1d741d92f6bb6c5b0cbf).
