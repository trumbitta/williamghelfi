		<h3 class="media-heading">Hey, hello. I'm William Ghelfi.</h3>

		<p>
			I was born, then suddenly started growing up. Never stopped since.<br />
			I'm a former poet and musician turned web developer, turned web designer, turned sysadmin, turned... you get the point.
		</p>

		<p>
			Being what I am, and all at once, earned me the privilege of being the QA Director at <a href="http://www.entando.com/">Entando</a> - the startup that's simplifying Enterprise Portals.
		</p>

		<p>
			I wrote <a href="/bootstrap-in-practice/">Bootstrap In Practice</a>, an ebook to help you start with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 3</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Outside work I'm a full-stack nerd, meaning that &mdash; yes &mdash; I read The Silmarillion. Five times. So far.
