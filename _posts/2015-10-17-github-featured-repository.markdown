You know that feeling. You stumble upon someone interesting at a conference, on Twitter, on Facebook, Reddit, Hacker News.
And they are a developer.

Next thing you know is you are staring at their GitHub profile, lost in dozens – and dozens – of repositories.
And there you linger, wondering how many of them are just quick experiments, and where the real gems are.

Where is that one repository this amazing developer is tenderly proud of?

Why, at the top of the first page, front and center.

So hey GitHub, please allow me to pin a featured repository of mine.

Also, I <3 you GitHub, [octohire me!](http://octohire.me)
