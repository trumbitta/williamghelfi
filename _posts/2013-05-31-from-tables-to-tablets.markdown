This is a three-part post I'm writing about my personal love story with CSS and web standards.

After 15 years, I think this passion of mine deserves a little recap to help me better appreciate
the past and focus on the next &mdash; for sure &mdash; decades of wonderful adventures.

## Part 1 of 3: Childhood

Well, in 1998 I was 21 so not really a child anymore, but in regard to the Internet in general and web development in particular I was at square 1.

I was gradually switching from playing keyboards to playing my computer's keyboard; I also started reading computer magazines, one of which was &mdash; wait for it &mdash; *Computer Magazine*: an italian monthly publication which would come with a juicy CD sporting all sorts of exciting new softwares for us to try and later purchase.

It was the wild *Age of Shareware*.

Long story short, here it comes *Microsoft Publisher 98*.  
It was clean, it had templates, it was WYSIWYG, I had something to say and one of the very first available 56K internet connections in Italy.  
Soon my first website was online, at Geocities.  
By then, I had discovered the *View HTML* option in my web browser but still I wasn't able to understand what I was seeing.

Then, in 1999, I had my hands on a copy of *Macromedia Dreamweaver*. I still can remember that exact moment when, as I was fiddling with the variuos options to see if I had found a suitable replacement for *Publisher*, my mind was suddenly blown away by this exact thought:

> Aspetta! Vuoi dire che io clicco sulla roba che vedo e tu mi scrivi l'HTML corrispondente sotto il naso?

Which, in english, would have been more or less:

>Wait! You telling me I click on stuff on the screen and you write HTML in my face?

<figure class="text-center">
	<img src="/images/html-written.jpg" alt=" " class="img-thumbnail" />
	<figcaption>
		<p>Me at the time of my sudden clarity moment</p>
	</figcaption>
</figure>

But, as often happens, life is not all kittens and HTML and it wasn't until 2000 that I started writing HTML instead of clicking on things to produce it.  
That year I landed my first real job at *L'Unione Editoriale*, a publishing house which was at the time the veteran of the italian part of the web.

There I finally learned to code HTML and write fairly complex layouts from the very start.  
Because, guess what, they were all **table layouts**.

I know, shame on me. But wait till [Part 2](/blog/2013/06/02/from-tables-to-tablets-part-2-of-3-adolescence/), where I'll redeem myself getting to know &mdash; and falling in love with &mdash; CSS!
