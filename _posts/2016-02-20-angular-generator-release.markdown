Angular Trumbitta – my Yeoman generator for enterprise Angular apps – v0.5.1 is now available.

## Notable changes:

* Fixed Angular version to 1.4.9, until I get better at Angular 1.5.0 :p
* Added Andrea Dessì in `package.json` as a contributor, for the sheer amount of feedback and for having added ngdoc support
* Added a `dist-package` grunt task, to get a packaged *dist* build in `tmp/build`

I spent a lot of time in starting a good `README`. Have a look at it if you'd like to know more about Angular Trumbitta!
