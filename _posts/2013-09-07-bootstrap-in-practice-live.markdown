And... Action!

[Bootstrap In Practice is live now](/bootstrap-in-practice).

For those who don't know, Bootstrap In Practice is my introduction to Bootstrap 3. I filled it with examples and made it a guide to help newcomers jump right into the framework and be productive from the start.

Here's what two early readers have to say about the topic:

> I'm in the book and I'm still going to buy a copy.<br />
>	It is that good.
>
> <small>Justin Dorfman, Bootstrap CDN &middot; powered by <a href="http://www.maxcdn.com/">MaxCDN</a></small>

<!-- dirty trick to fool markdown -->

>	Having been a programmer for the last 30 years, I didn't know anything about web design.<br />
>	With Bootstrap In Practice, I was finally able to take Bootstrap for a spin.
>
>	And I like it!
>
> <small>Rinaldo Bonazzo, Product Specialist Manager at Entando</small>

To get a better idea of the book, download the sample chapter about the new grid system:

{% include custom/ckform-course.html %}

You can see all the extras and buy a copy of the book, on [its dedicated page](/bootstrap-in-practice).
