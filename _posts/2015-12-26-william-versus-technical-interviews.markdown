I found out I'm not built for *classic* technical interviews. I'll go a step farther and declare I, in fact, *hate* the aforementioned kind of interviews.

And that's because they are useless. Their uselessness always hit me with such strenght I just freeze.

*"But I just need to see how you think, how you approach a problem!"*  
Yeah, read my code on GitHub for that.

Seriously, stop asking a candidate to sort an array of integers.

Want to know how I approach the problem of sorting an array of integers?  
Here's a copy-paste of my thoughts, straight from my mind:

**At work:**

1. Oh, this smells of **solved** problem
2. Yep, sorting an array of integers. Definitely a solved problem.
3. `myarray.sort()`
4. Ok, enough of this BS, let's get back building things

**In a technical interview:**

1. Oh, this smells of **solved** problem
2. Yep, sorting an array of integers. Definitely a solved problem.
3. I can't believe you are asking me to solve a solved problem, this is is just useless.
4. *Y U NO ASK ME REAL QUESTIONS?*
4. **KERNEL PANIC**

And don't let me start with when I apply for a UX / front-end position, and not a single question about UX is asked. Just, you know, sorting arrays.

Or finding duplicates.

We are professionals, ask us to show you our work. Ask us to build things (and give us time to work on it without you staring at us).

We are professionals, stop asking us to solve solved problems.

There are only two kinds of people capable of brilliantly solving a solved problem:

1. Students, or freshly-graduated fellows
2. People who does *a lot* of technical interviews

The majority of us is neither.

*pls, stahp*
