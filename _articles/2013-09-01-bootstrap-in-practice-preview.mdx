If you already subscribed to the mailing list, you may have received a little sneak peek with the Table of Contents plus the Introduction and the interview with Mark Otto, creator of Bootstrap.

I'm linking it again here, just in case: [Get the sneak peek [PDF &middot; 3MB]](/attachments/Bootstrap_In_Practice-Sneakpeek.pdf)

## Mystery release date

I plan to release _Bootstrap In Practice_ on **a mystery day from Sept. 5th to Sept. 8th**.
There will be a _"launch day sale"_, so for the first 24 hours the prices will be lower.

The day before the launch, I will send an email on the mailing list announcing it. So, basically, if you are on [the mailing list](/bootstrap-in-practice) you will know about the launch day in time for the launch day sale.

## Packages

These final days I'm working hard to finalize two different packages for you to choose from:

### The complete package

- **~200 page PDF book**
- **3 Git repositories** with the sources of the hands-on chapters from Part 2, with every incremental step enclosed in a single commit
- **3 original Themestrap themes** you can use for refreshing the default look and feel of Bootstrap
- **Description of my daily work environment** featuring browsers, editor, plugins, tools and more

### The budget package

- **~200 page PDF book**

Also, on the final sales page I will include a sample chapter, different from the sneak peek, and covering your first page with Bootstrap 3 as we learn about the new grid system.

## A goodbye!

So, the time is coming. In less than 10 days, _Bootstrap In Practice_ will be here.

Stay tuned!
