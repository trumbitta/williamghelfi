## I have a plan

Hello! Since I was going to redesign my blog using Bootstrap 3, I thought it would be fun to document my step-by-step progress in a blog post. Or, in other words:

<Figure>

![](/images/posts/2013-08-11-bootstrap-in-practice-blogception/yo-dawg-i-heard-you-like-blogs.jpg)

</Figure>

So this is the plan, and this also why for some time you should expect discrepancies between the look & feel of the blog posts and the overall design of the website while I'm rewriting the various layouts and includes in Octopress.

## A beginning

Anyway. Here we have the minimum core of a proper blog post, and we also started to set it up with Bootstrap 3:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Bootstrap In Practice - Blog example</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <!-- Bootstrap -->
    <link
      href="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0-rc1/css/bootstrap.min.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <article class="col-12 col-lg-10 col-offset-1">
          <header>
            <h1>Blogception</h1>
            <p class="meta">
              <time datetime="2013-08-11T17:55:00+02:00">Aug 11th, 2013</time> |
              <a href="#disqus_thread">Comments</a>
            </p>
          </header>

          <blockquote>
            <p>

          <p>
            Anyway. Here we have the minimum core of a proper blog post, and we
            also started to set it up with Bootstrap 3:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Up there in the <code>head</code>, Bootstrap from the great guys
              at NetDNA &mdash; hey, thanks again!
            </li>
            <li>
              An wide and centered article, slightly narrower at desktop sizes
              and which is containing the whole post
            </li>
            <li>
              A nerd<em>ish</em> title for our post, followed by a publishing
              date and a pointer to the comments section. All of them packed
              into a <code>header</code> element.
            </li>
            <li>An intro with accompanying picture</li>
          </ul>
        </article>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

- Up there in the `head`, Bootstrap from the great guys at NetDNA &mdash; hey, thanks again!
- A wide and centered article, slightly narrower at desktop sizes and which is containing the whole post
- A nerd*ish* title for our post, followed by a publishing date and a pointer to the comments section. All of them packed into a `header` element.
- An intro with accompanying picture

## Easier to the eyes

Before proceeding further, let's adjust the font size for an easier reading. We are all here on a blog, reading a blog post, after all.
I'm going to add some overriding styles using a `style` element into the `head` of this document.

```html
<style>
  /* Overriding for fun and profit */

  body {
    /* 17 is better than 16 is better than 14 */
    font-size: 17px;
  }

  pre {
    font-size: 16px;
  }
</style>
```

While this is perfect for showing all the code in a single place, for real world scenarios it's always better to put the stylesheets into separated files and link them back into the document.

A good name for such a file, would certainly be something like `bootstrap-override.css`.

## Highlight my fire

And, since nobody likes code snippets without syntax highlighting, we are now going to add [Prism by Lea Verou](http://prismjs.com/) to our blog post. I'm leaving out line numbers, because I got some problems with vertical alignments.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    ...
    <link href="prism.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
    <script src="prism.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Not much pain. We only needed to add the js library and our theme of choice &mdash; I chose _Twilight_ &mdash; and now we are good to go.

## Closing the post

This _blogception_ is coming to an end, so we need to add the closing bits:

```html
<div id="disqus_thread"></div>

<hr />

<footer>
  <span class="vcard">
    Posted by
    <address class="author"><span class="fn">William Ghelfi</span></address>
    on
    <time datetime="2013-08-11T17:55:00+02:00" class="published"
      >Aug 11th, 2013</time
    >
  </span>
  <span class="pull-right">
    <a class="label label-info" href="/blog/categories/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>
    <a class="label label-info" href="/blog/categories/css/">CSS</a>
  </span>
  <hr />
  <!-- Insert tweet button here -->
  <ul class="pager">
    <li class="previous">
      <a
        href="/blog/2013/08/04/bootstrap-in-practice-a-landing-page/"
        title="Previous Post: Bootstrap in Practice: A Landing Page"
        >&larr; Bootstrap in Practice: A Landing Page</a
      >
    </li>
    <li class="next">
      <a href="/fakeurl" title="Next Post: Fake Title">Fake Title &rarr;</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</footer>
```

- A placeholder for the comments section using Disqus &mdash; but I'm not going to show you how to use Disqus
- Who wrote the post, and when it was published
- Categories this post is related to
- A placeholder for the _tweet this_ button &mdash; same as for Disqus above
- A pager pointing to the previous or next post as needed

## Final touches

Before saying goodbye, we are going to prettify things a bit.

Stay with me while we add a nicer font for the headings, push the opening date and the link to the commens above the main title, and adjust some margin and padding here and there:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <link
    href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Fjalla+One"
    rel="stylesheet"
    type="text/css"
  />
  ...

  <style>
    </code>
    	<code class="language-css">
    	/* Overriding for fun and profit */

    	body {
    		/* 17 is better than 16 is better than 14 */
    		font-size: 17px;
    	}

    	pre {
    	  font-size: 16px;
    	}

    	header {
    		position: relative;
    		margin-bottom: 1.5em;
    		padding: 1.8em 0 1em 0;
    	}

    	header h1 {
    		margin: 0;
    		padding: 0;
    	}

    	header .meta {
    		position: absolute;
    		top: 0;
    		left: 0;
    		margin: 0;
    		padding: 0;
    		text-transform: uppercase;
    		font-size: 0.9em;
    		color: #aaa;
    	}

    	footer {
    		font-size: 0.9em;
    	}

    	h1, h2 {
    		font-family: "Fjalla One", Arial, serif;
    		font-weight: 400;
    		margin-bottom: 1em;
    	}

    	article h2 {
    		padding-top: 0.8em;
    	}

    	figure {
    		margin: 2em 0;
    	}

    	.author {
    		display: inline;
    	}</code><code class="language-markup">
  </style>
</head>
```

I'm not sure I won't come back to the code and refine some edgy corners &mdash; for instance, I'm not quite happy with the overall vertical rythm &mdash; but the final result plays nicely with a Mobile First approach and I hope to have accomplished the mission: showing how to create a clean and readable blog post with Bootstrap 3!
