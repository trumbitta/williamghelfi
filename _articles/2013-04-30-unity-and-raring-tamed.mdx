title: How I tamed Unity on Ubuntu 13.04

I like Unity.
I mean, I like the new menu system and window manager. And. It. Stops. Right. There.

So here's how I managed to retain some mental sanity and reach a good balance between my needs as a human being with a computer and the crazy interface designers working hard at Ubuntu to make us all go bonkers.

## My desktop

Keep on reading for how to obtain it.

## Phase 1 - Unity Launcher GTFO

1. `sudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool`
2. Open `Unity Tweak Tool` and use it to:

- Shrink the Launcher width
- Make it automatically hide till summoned (_lol, seriously, dude. You're not going to be summoned **EVER AGAIN**._)

## Phase 2 - Unity Dash sucks, Gnome Do rocks

1. `sudo apt-get install gnome-do`
2. `ALT + F2` → `gnome-do`
3. Edit the preferences and give it a new shortcut like `<Super>space`

## Phase 3 - Unity Launcher, I told you to GTFO

1. `sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager`
2. `ALT + F2` → `ccsm`
3. `Filter` → `Unity` → choose `Ubuntu Unity Plugin`
4. Go to the `Launcher` panel → `Key to show the Dash, Launcher, and Help Overlay` → `<Control><Super>`

So it is `<Super>space` to summon the crazy powerful **gnome-do** and `<Control><Super>` to summon **Dash the sucker**.

## Phase 4 - I am a human being. I need a taskbar and panel.

1. `sudo apt-get install tint2`
2. `<Super>space` → `tint2`
   - Optionally [change the default appearance](https://code.google.com/p/tint2/wiki/Configure)
3. Beer

I used to be very happy with **Docky**, but with Ubuntu 13.04 it was super crashy. On the other hand, **Cairo Dock** was just too much for me.
All in all, **tint2** was the perfect fit.
Kudos to [Andrea Dessì @NKjoep](https://twitter.com/NKjoep) for pointing it to me!

## Bonus - My tint2rc

To make **tint2** feel a bit more **Docky** and a bit less _taskbar_ (as you can see in the screenshot at the beginning of the post).
