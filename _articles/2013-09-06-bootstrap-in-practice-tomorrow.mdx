It's been a long ride, and I am tired but happy. I learned a lot about myself and about things I didn't know.
But let's go straight to the important stuff!

## The Book

_Bootstrap In Practice_ is a 197 pages long PDF filled with examples.

Here is the table of contents:

#### Part 1 &mdash; Knowing Bootstrap

1 &middot; What's Bootstrap
2 &middot; Your First Page
3 &middot; Styled HTML Fundamentals
4 &middot; Components
5 &middot; JavaScript Plugins
6 &middot; Resources

#### Part 2 &mdash; Using Bootstrap

7 &middot; A Landing Page
8 &middot; Create, Update, Delete, (Hit) List
9 &middot; A Blog Post

This is the book I wish there was two years ago, when I started using Bootstrap.
It will help you to quickly grasp the basics (well, much more than the basics actually) and get productive in the littlest time possbile.

## The Interviews

Included with the book, there are also quick but insightful textual interviews with five champions of the Web and Bootstrap.

- Mark Otto, creator of Bootstrap
- Brad Frost, future friendly frontend designer
- Justin Dorfman, maintainer of Bootstrap CDN by NetDNA
- Michael Bleigh, CEO of Divshot
- Thomas H. Park, creator of Bootswatch

## The Extras

I put together a _hands-on_ complete package which includes:

- The book.
- 3 original Themestrap themes for refreshing the default look & feel of Bootstrap.
- 3 Git repositories with the source code of chapters 7, 8, 9 and every incremental step enclosed in a single commit.
- The description of a tested work environment with tips, plugins, and more.

## A Sample Chapter

I asked to the mailing list what part of Bootstrap was the hardest to understand for the newcomers, and the response was clear and loud: the new grid system.

So here's [the new grid system, tamed for free](/bootstrap-in-practice/#free-chapter).

To everyone who has helped, inspired, supported me, thank you so much! And to my wife, who always gives me strength right when I need it: I love you!

[_Bootstrap In Practice_](/bootstrap-in-practice) goes live tomorrow. Stay tuned!
